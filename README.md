# Matlab to C++ Translation Kit

This repository contains utility functions for writing your own matlab to C++ translations.
It is not meant to be an exact translation, but rather a starting point for your own translation.

If you want to run matlab code in C++, user the matlab coder plugin if you have access to it, or Octave if you want an open source solution.

If you instead are looking to translate matlab code to C++ and attempt to make it more efficient, this repository is for you.
